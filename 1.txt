			<h2 class="right-heading">Proven Termites Baiting System</h2>
			<div class="content-subbox">
				<p>Termite baiting is to place a food source that contains toxicant. Foraging 
					termites that find the baits will consume and share the food containing 
					the toxicant with its nest mates including the Queen and the King through 
					a process called trophallaxis. Elimination process may require 
					approximately 2 to 12 weeks depending on the size of the colony, typically 
					6 to 8 weeks. There will be two types of baiting system that we use which 
					are In-Ground Baiting System which for preventing future invading colony 
					from infesting the premises and Above Ground Baiting System which is to 
					eliminate current termite infestation in the premises.</p>

				<p>Pre-Construction Anti termite treatment is normally carried out before 
					construction <!--of homes, schools, buildings etc--> and Post-Construction 
					Anti Termite Treatment is after construction.
					<br><br>
					It is a process where we treat the soil for termite control. Subterranean 
					Termite can cause great losses to the interest of man especially in houses 
					and buildings in urban areas. They also affect crops, habitation or 
					utilities such as wooden poles. There have even been reports of termites 
					damaging plastic or lead sheathings of underground cables.
					<br><br>
					We spray or inject termiticide to different stages of construction for pre 
					constructed buildings and drill holes surrounding the buildings for 
					post constructed. After treatment is carried out a service warranty of 5, 
					3, or 2 years was awarded to the client. Nowadays all government newly 
					constructed projects have a stringent requirement to apply 
					pre-construction anti termite treatment for its buildings.</p>
